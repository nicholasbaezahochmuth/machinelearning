    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM stands for \"support vector machines\". They are efficient and easy to use estimators. They come in two kinds: SVCs (Support Vector Classifiers) for classification, and SVRs (Support Vector Regressors) for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear SVMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM module contains `LinearSVC()`. Using `SVC(kernel = \"linear\")` will also yield a linear predictor different in minor technical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel SVMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of SVMs lies in using *kernels*, which allow for non-linear decision boundaries. A kernal defines a similarity measuer between data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common kernels:\n",
    "* **linear** - will give a linear decision frontier. It is the most computationally efficient approach.\n",
    "* **poly** - will give decision frontiers that are polynomial. The order given by the `order` argument.\n",
    "* **rbf** - uses 'radial basis functions' centered at each support vector to assemble a decision frontier. The size of the RBFs controls the smoothness of the decision frontier. RBFs are the most flexible but require the most data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions in a kernel-SVM are made using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat y = sign(\\alpha_{0} + \\Sigma_{j} \\alpha_{j} y_{j} k(x^{(j)}, x)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x^{(j)}$ are training samples, $y^{(j)}$ the corresponding labels, $x$ is a test-sample to predict on, $k$ is the kernel, and $\\alpha$ are learned parameters."
